# Search Engine built from scratch using MERN and Python

This is a Search Engine for your PDF books. Once you upload all the upload PDFs, the server makes a vector space model(using TF-IDF) of the books. 
When the user puts in a query, the search engine finds exactly what pages and which books match your qeury, then it ranks them based on relevance and displays them on page.
